# Command Palette

I wanted a tool to lower the friction for sending complex commands to Discord Bots, without the need for remembering or setting up macros.

This tool allows you to create any number of commands, populated in groups, with a one-click copy to clipboard functionality.

A fast, entirely local alternative to copy-paste from a text document. It's all about lowering friction to the minimum.
